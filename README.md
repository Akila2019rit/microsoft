# SALARY-PREDICTOR-2022
A Machine learning model used to predict salary income using two class boosted decision
# PROBLEM STATEMENT
This salary prediction model is used to predict the income salary of many person.The algorithm used in this model is (Two Class Boosted decision).This model is not only used to predict the salary income of the person,it also reduces the man-labour work and reduces the time efficiency.
# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
We need to get data. We'll use a sample data set for that.The raw data is completely infused in the workspace. The entries includes education, qualifications and status. Preprocessing is done before the analyzing part. The data must be clean so that the model can analyze correctly. For that the rows with empty values are removed. A module is added for that process. Individual measurable properties are called features.The model is build accordingly. Now that the data is ready, constructing a predictive model consists of training and testing. We'll use our data to train the model, and then we'll test the model to see how closely it's able to predict salary of the individual person.
# AZURE SERVICES USED
Azure machine learning studio is used to create, train and evaluate the machine learning model. In Azure machine learning portal, select or import a dataset for the model. After uploading the dataset as CSV file, then select the blocks for the model and then connect and visualize the blocks. The final output will be visualized in the evaluated model.
